Thank you for downloading my UnderworldRP Motels Script, this will enable users to purchase a motel same you specify in the Config file.

All locations and rooms are configured 1 position in the Config.lua file, please ensure you keep the "format" how it is currently, should be pretty easy to know how to add a extra motel or use franklin and michael house in dlc, simply copy the format of the Franklin House Under city already entered.
